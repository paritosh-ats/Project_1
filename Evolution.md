🧩 PMBus — Power Management Bus

PMBus (Power Management Bus) is an open-standard communication protocol based on SMBus/I²C, designed specifically for digital power management and control.
It allows system designers to monitor, configure, and control power converters and regulators through a standardized set of commands.

PMBus supports:

Real-time voltage, current, temperature, and fault telemetry

Dynamic power configuration and sequencing

Fault reporting and recovery mechanisms

Compatibility with a wide range of power ICs and controllers

The latest version, PMBus 1.5, adds security, higher data rates, and enhanced telemetry logging, making it suitable for advanced SoC and FPGA-based power systems.

# 🧩 PMBus Evolution — Feature-Wise Comparison

The Power Management Bus (PMBus) specification has evolved through multiple versions since its inception in 2005.  
Below is a **feature-wise comparison** of PMBus versions, showing how functionality expanded over time.
