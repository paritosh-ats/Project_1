    ## Overview

    An AC‚ÄìDC power supply is an electronic device that converts alternating current (AC) from the mains (like 230 V, 50 Hz in India) into direct current (DC) required by most electronic circuits and digital devices.
It‚Äôs also called a rectifier power supply or adapter.

    ## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Stages of Conversion

    Step-down Transformer

    Reduces high AC voltage (e.g., 230 V) to a lower level (e.g., 12 V or 24 V AC).

    Some modern supplies use ‚Äúswitch-mode‚Äù techniques without transformers.

    Rectifier Circuit

    Converts AC to pulsating DC using diodes.

    Common types: Half-wave, Full-wave, or Bridge rectifier.

    Filter Circuit

    Smooths out the pulsating DC using capacitors or inductors.

    Voltage Regulator

    Maintains a stable DC output despite fluctuations in load or input voltage.

    Examples: Linear regulators (e.g., LM7805) or Switching regulators (SMPS).

    ## ‚ö° Types

    Linear Power Supply

    Simple design, uses transformer and linear regulators.

    Advantages: Low noise, stable.

    Disadvantages: Heavy and less efficient.

    Switch-Mode Power Supply (SMPS)

    Uses high-frequency switching for voltage conversion.

    Advantages: Lightweight, efficient, compact.

    Disadvantages: Can produce switching noise.
